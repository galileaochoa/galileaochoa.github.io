Hello, my name is Galilea. I am a physicist and astronomer, currently engaged in exoplanet research. I have a passion for drawing and painting, and I am also learning how to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This website is a reflection of my interests and my journey in the fascinating world of science and coding.
